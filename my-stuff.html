<h2>Jacksonville - My Favorite Place</h2>
<p>My favorite place to visit is Jacksonville, Florida. I used to live in Jacksonville prior to moving to Atlanta. While I went to school there, I fell in love with the area for its food options, proximity to the ocean and attractions, and nearby family that I could quickly visit.<p>

<h2>Types of Food</h2>
<p>Many very popular foods tend to call for a mix of ingredients when making them. In America, in particular, several foods considered to be ‘American’ (or an appropriation from another country) may have the same name while having different ingredients or instructions on how to make it. Two more popular foods found in the country, particularly in Jacksonville in part due to climate, are mentioned below in regard to their most popular ingredients. </p>

<h3>BURGER (HOMEMADE)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Ground beef/Beyond Beef (dependent on dietary preferences)</li>
<li>Bread crumbs</li>
<li>Egg/Just Egg (dependent on dietary preferences)</li>
</ol>

<h3>SPAGHETTI</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sauce (several flavor options exist for this category, i.e. tomato basil, marinara, vodka, etc.)</li>
<li>Pasta noodles</li>
<li>Ground Beef/Ground Turkey/Beyond Beef (dependent on dietary preferences)</li>
</ol>
