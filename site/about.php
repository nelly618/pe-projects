			<about>
				<p class='developer-info'>As a web developer, I work to provide design that is interactive, accessible, and attractive for users. I hope to work with a company that values experience that also provides a different perspective. </p>
				<p class='hcw-info'>I have 7 years of experience in the healthcare sector, and have been a practicing PA since 2019. While training with Perpetual Education, I continue to work with patients full-time.</p>
				<p class='regular-info'>Outside of development and medicine, you can find me walking my dog, at the gym, watching some (not-so) trashy TV, looking for a new place to travel to, or trying new plant-based recipes.</p>
