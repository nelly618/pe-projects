		<h1>My Learning Process</h1>
		<p>Today is Day 23 of my Design for the Web mentorship, and I'm loving it! It's different from what most think of as 'bootcamps' because not only does it provide a very foundational set of lectures to help us understand how a lanaguage is interpreted and understood, but it also lets us explore more possiblilities of where this time can lead us, whether for a career or for more personal use. I'm looking forward to jumping more into HTML and seeing where we go from here! 👩🏾‍💻</p>
