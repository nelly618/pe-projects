<p>The purpose of this document is to manipulate Google Doc to certain specifications and discuss the advantages available for real-time collaboration for a project/product. In this instance, we will be discussing Jacksonville, Florida and food options.</p>

<h2>Jacksonville - My Favorite Place</h2>
<p>My favorite place to visit is Jacksonville, Florida. I used to live in Jacksonville prior to moving to Atlanta. While I went to school there, I fell in love with the area for its food options, proximity to the ocean and attractions, and nearby family that I could quickly visit.<p> 
<ul>
<li>Food options</li>
<li>Family/friends nearby</li>
<li>Proximity to the beach and attractions in the state</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Food</h2>
<p>Many very popular foods tend to call for a mix of ingredients when making them. In America, in particular, several foods considered to be ‘American’ (or an appropriation from another country) may have the same name while having different ingredients or instructions on how to make it. Two more popular foods found in the country, particularly in Jacksonville in part due to climate, are mentioned below in regard to their most popular ingredients. </p>

<h3>BURGER (HOMEMADE)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Ground beef/Beyond Beef (dependent on dietary preferences)</li>
<li>Bread crumbs</li>
<li>Egg/Just Egg (dependent on dietary preferences)</li>
</ol>

<h3>SPAGHETTI</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sauce (several flavor options exist for this category, i.e. tomato basil, marinara, vodka, etc.)</li>
<li>Pasta noodles</li>
<li>Ground Beef/Ground Turkey/Beyond Beef (dependent on dietary preferences)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Visit Jacksonville, Florida Today!</h2>
<p>Jacksonville, Florida is not only a great vacation spot, but it also offers a variety of foods that are popular throughout the country and cooked/prepared in various ways throughout the city alone. The proximity it has not only to the beach, but also to other attractions in the state also provides an incentive to visit that makes Jacksonville a near-irresistible location to stop through.</p>
